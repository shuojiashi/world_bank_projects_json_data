This is a json based file mini project. 
The purpose of the project is to practice working with python:
1. Find the 10 countries with most projects
2. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
3. In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.
